# Shitpost Learner

shitpost /SCHIT-pohst/ - a comment that contains nothing of intended value, but at the
same time is not intended to troll with.

This script uses Markov chains to learn how to shitpost. Using a user-specified board,
this script trains a Markov chain on all posts on the first page of that board (all 10
pages takes a long time!) and generates shitposts on command.

This makes extensive use of 4chan's read-only JSON API.
